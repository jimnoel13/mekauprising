There are the Eagle and Falcon Mekas who specialize in attack, the Owl Mekas with sharp 360-degree visions used for probing, then there are Ostrich Mekas serving as transportation vehicles for the Kaburians. The Avian attack force is exceptionally tricky to handle. They dive down from an altitude to finish their opponents with their all-piercing sharp claws.

Most of the Exo Mekas fight up high just like the Avians, although from a lower altitude. Some of them are even capable of traveling underground and trap their opponents from below.

But don’t be fooled, Marines can fight on land, too. They are incredibly valuable assets of the Atlanteans, for they make way for foolproof strategies that incorporate multiple battlegrounds.

And so, they manufactured the strongest Mekas of all - the Null-type. Each Null-type Meka is a hybrid of different Meka types, making them highly unpredictable and exceptionally adept at dealing with any type of attackers. Combining multiple genes into one Mekas is almost an impossible feat, and thus the effort is more than rewarding. With a less than 5% chance, a Null-type Meka can mutate and take the shape of the Tardigrade, an indestructible creature that can be thrown into any environment.

This means that half of the planet will always face the light, while the other is drenched in darkness and cold. No New Human lives in the Dark Zone, they only went there once, to dispose of the failed Meka prototypes. Having witnessed Brale’s success in creating hybrid Mekas, the other nations tried to follow suit. But all their experiments turned out to be disasters, the hybrid Mekas became aggressive and unstable, and eventually had to be put down. All of them were thrown into a huge pile in the Dark Zone. That was the New Humans’ biggest mistake. Little did they know, the Dark Zone is home to a dangerous parasite, which took over the dead hybrid Mekas’ bodies, shed the metal on their skin, and became what is now known as the Chimeras - the biggest threat mankind has ever witnessed. The Chimeras proceeded to mate and create even more monstrous offspring, who, after generations of evolution, grew to be gigantic in size and carry in them more power combinations than ever. And only having witnessed the appearance of the Chimera demons did the New Humans realize their mistakes, and ceased the World War. They finally banded together and commanded their Mekas to attack the mutual enemies.'}\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n    .landing-page-story{\r\n        background: url('../../public/images/mu-banner-bg7.png');\r\n        background-position: center center;\r\n        background-repeat: no-repeat;\r\n        background-attachment: fixed;\r\n        background-size: cover;\r\n    }\r\n</style>","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--13-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--1-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Story.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--13-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--1-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Story.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./Story.vue?vue&type=template&id=78311238&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./Story.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./Story.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./Story.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=78311238&scoped=true&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"78311238\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--7-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--7-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--7-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--1-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Story.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=78311238&scoped=true&lang=css&\""],"sourceRoot":""}
